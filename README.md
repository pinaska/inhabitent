# Inhabitent-WP-site
This is a multi-page site for a fictional store nhabitent Camping Supply Co. using WordPress as CMS.

-- personal learning:
due to the many css changes required by this project, I searched for the way to see in Chrome Development Tool what source sass file containes the element, so I can easily target it whith my changes. I installed npm dependencies to get source map. [link 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6843495/how-to-save-css-changes-of-styles-panel-of-chrome-developer-tools), [link 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps). Now I see the initial sass files in my dev tools and can apply and save changes right from there (no need for switching to VS code);

-- transform translateY
